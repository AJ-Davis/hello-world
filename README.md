# hello-world
Stoked to be here!

Hi! My name is AJ and I am a Philly dude. My interests include the Sixers, cheesesteaks, camping, adventures, my dog Denna, life efficiency, and gardening. I am an Economist by training transitioning into Data Science. Topics I intend to explore are marijuana legalization, energy efficiency, and basketball.
I hate the Boston Celtics!
